A proof-of concept NES emulator written in Rust.

*Status*
The CPU is almost done.

The code no longer compiles on recent rust versions. I hope to move forward with the project a little more and convert to modern rust syntax shortly after [rust hits 1.0](http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/02/13/Final-1.0-timeline.html).
